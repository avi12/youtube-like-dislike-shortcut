# YouTube Like-Dislike Shortcut
Basically copies the like/dislike shortcut from YouTube Music, which means:  
* Shift+Plus (on the number row) to like a video
* Shift+Minus (on the number row) to dislike
* Numpad Plus to like
* Numpad Minus to dislike

Additionally:
* Shift+0 (on the number row) to remove your like/dislike
* Pressing the like/dislike shortcut while the corresponding button is active (i.e. pressed), will do nothing
